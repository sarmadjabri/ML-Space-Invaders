# ML-Space-Invaders
How cool would it be for Machine learning to try Space invaders because why not. Fork this repository and build. For those watching this repository thanks for watching please build off of this and maybe share what you came up with. 

Project Description:
  Double DQN neural network paired with reinforcement learning
  Uses pre trained model and builds off of current progress from that
  Small scale and should be scaled up for those who aren't using potato computers.
  More information is in the code comments accomadated by AI for explanation.
