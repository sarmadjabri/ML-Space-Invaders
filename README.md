# ML-Space-Invaders
How cool would it be for Machine learning to try Space invaders because why not. Fork this repository and build. For those watching this repository thanks for watching please build off of this and maybe share what you came up with. 

## Project Description:
  Double DQN neural network paired with reinforcement learning
  Uses pre trained model and builds off of current progress
  More information is in the code comments accomadated by AI for explanation.

## Notes
- This project is not finished yet, will continue progressing on structure till completion
- Files for setting up the environment should be added shortly
- Will create a way to load current progress to prevent first time training from happening too often.
